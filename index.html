          Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter
          developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.[3] Teased under
          the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta
          period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on
          June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant
          takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several
          mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while
          moving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the
          near future.[4][5][6][7] Players play as one of a set of Agents,
          characters based on several countries and cultures around the
          world.[7] In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the
          attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it.
          Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a
          unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths,
          orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic"
          pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.[5] Other weapons
          and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system
          that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any
          kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The
          game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like
          sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine
          guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.[8][9] There are automatic and
          semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that
          has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.[9]
          It currently offers 23 agents to choose from.[3][10][11] The player
          will get 5 unlocked agents when they create their account, and will
          have to unlock the rest of the agents by collecting an in-game
          currency called Kingdom Credits. Kingdom Credits can be acquired by
          playing games or completing daily and weekly tasks, and can be spent
          on unlocking new agents or cosmetic items. However, within the first
          28 days of release, new Agents can only be unlocked with Valorant
          Points (VP), Agent Recruitment Events, or by having a linked and
          active Xbox Game Pass subscription. VP is an in-game currency that can
          only obtained by purchasing it with real money,[12][better source
          needed] and it can be spent on cosmetic items or new agents.

          Duelists are self-sufficient fraggers who their team expects, through

          <br />
          Duelists are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in
          VALORANT. Agents under this role have abilities that allow them to
          focus on being the first to enter sites and engage the enemy. Unlike
          other Agent classes, the Signature abilities for Duelists need to be
          recharged with 2 kills rather than a period of time.

          The abilities of agents under this role allow them to assist their
