            — Official Duelist Description
            <br />
            Duelists are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in
            VALORANT. Agents under this role have abilities that allow them to
            focus on being the first to enter sites and engage the enemy. Unlike
            other Agent classes, the Signature abilities for Duelists need to be
            recharged with 2 kills rather than a period of time. The game
            currently has seven Duelist agents in its roster.
